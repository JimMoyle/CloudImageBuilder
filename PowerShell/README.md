Note: Biggest change is the custom template with the added customization (file downloads and PowerShell scripts) and some minor variable name changes as I gave them more descriptive names.

All changes to the template are based on the directives from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/install-office-on-wvd-master-image
